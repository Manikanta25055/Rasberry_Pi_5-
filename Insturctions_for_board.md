- Do you want to change anything in the circuit? always a power of the raspberry pi first
- when powered on, avoid touching the circuit.
- Double or triple-check the circuit before putting in the power cable.
- Start the circuit by connecting GND to all components.
- Dont put 5v signal for GPIO's, 3.3 max
